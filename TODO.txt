* Load profiles even if they are not in our leaderboard table
* Load leaderboard by scanning the GMX arbitrum blockchain.

* Improve DB security. Get better password storage, and don't do pure SQL calls,
have us use an ORM like https://kysely.dev/.

Use a secrets manager, environment variables (DO NOT commit `.env` files to your repository), or a similar solution, to avoid hardcoding database credentials in your code.


* Get the correct leverage amount based on the smart contract? The website changes it based on the price or something else...
I want the original leverage.

* If a trader drops below rank 20, we don't properly update him and we end up with 2 traders with the rank #20.

* Don't rely on GMX SDK, directly access the GMX information through the Arbitrum network.
